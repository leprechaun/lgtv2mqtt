> Interface between LG WebOS Smart TVs and MQTT ðŸ“º

### Getting started

-   TV configuration

You need to allow "LG Connect Apps" on your TV - see http://www.lg.com/uk/support/product-help/CT00008334-1437131798537-others

- lgtv2mqtt Configuration

You will need to specify the following ENV variables
    - `TOPIC_PREFIX`: a string to be prepended to the MQTT topic hierachy this tool relies on
    - `MQTT_HOST`: the hostname and port of the MQTT broker (eg, mqtt://mybroker.com)
    - `TV_IP`: The IP or hostname of the LG TV
    - `TV_CLIENT_KEY`: (optional) the key that allows this software to remain authenticated with the LG TV after authorizing on the unit. You can extract this value from `~/.lgtv2/`. See https://github.com/hobbyquaker/lgtv2?tab=readme-ov-file#options


-   Install

`npm install -g lgtv2mqtt`

-   Start
